## Welcome to Geaux Garden!

Thank you for checking out my new and very public digital garden, Geaux Garden! I am excited to finally have a digital garden that is public and that I will actually share and update consistently. 

I have always manage to avoid publishing a digital garden somehow and end up with all these little private note spaces that miss out on the benefits of having your own little corner of the internet that allows you to create in public. I hope you find my writing useful and interesting while also giving me honest feedback on how to get better or improve - I am constantly trying to be a better developer, writer, and person each and every day. 

### What to Expect
