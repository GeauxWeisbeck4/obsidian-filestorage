# Saturday - February 15th, 2025

I am finally getting around to getting my day started - I also think I finally have Obsidian set up halfway the way I want it to be. A lot to go in that camp still. I will be doing my morning free write in Logseq and figuring out how to integrate that into my Digital Garden. On to the good stuff!
