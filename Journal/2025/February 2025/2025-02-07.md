# Friday - February 7th, 2025
- So I am still working on getting back into the flow of things since my nearly month long hiatus when my laptop broke and then I ended up getting really sick. Totally a bummer of a way to start off the new year. But I am back on track and focused now - I really need to get back in the swing of coding, learning, and writing. I need to find work and get some real money coming in ya know.
