# Geaux Garden Home

Geaux Garden is my digital garden (this website) - my own little corner of the internet where I work in public, share ideas and notes, learn, and create.

### [Geaux-Garden.vercel.app](https://geaux-garden.vercel.app)

## Goals
### 1. Work in public and get feedback on ideas and work.
### 2. Market and network myself and skills.
### 3. Help other developers learn and grow from my experiences and own knowledge.
### 4. Establish a productive deep work flow that allows me to be most effective in my work.
### 5. Create a cool website that people enjoy visiting.

## Challenges
- ### A lot going on at the moment in my life so it can be hard to take time to write notes and share them.
- ### Struggled to find a good workflow that allows me to be efficient but also easily share my work on the web.
- ### Starting from scratch was just taking too much time, but I still want to add my own flavor to current templates.
