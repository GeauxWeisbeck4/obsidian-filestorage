# Perplexity Resume Rewrite

Okay, I can help you tailor your resume to the Web Applications Developer position at NC State University Libraries. I'll analyze your resume and the job description, then provide suggestions for rewording and re-emphasizing your experience to align with their requirements.

Here's a breakdown of my approach, followed by specific recommendations:

**1. Understanding the Job Requirements:**

*   **Core Technologies:** The job emphasizes HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and a server-side language like Python (preferred), PHP, or Ruby. Experience with relational databases (SQL) and Git is also key. Containerization (Docker/Podman) and Python for scripting/automation are strong pluses.
*   **Key Skills & Abilities:** They're looking for someone who can:

    *   Consult with stakeholders to identify needs.
    *   Implement effective technology solutions.
    *   Work independently and in a team.
    *   Communicate well (functional requirements, documentation).
*   **Desired Experience:** Development of web applications, designing/implementing user interfaces, and supporting applications.

**2. Analyzing Your Current Resume:**

Based on the attached resume ("AndrewCV.pdf"):

*   **Strengths:**

    *   You have solid full-stack experience (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
    *   You've deployed web applications.
    *   You've improved app performance and integrated APIs.
    *   You have experience with Docker.
    *   You have experience contributing to open-source projects.
    *   You have experience with Python.

*   **Areas for Improvement/Focus:**

    *   **Prioritize Python:** Since the job description highlights Python, make sure your Python experience is very prominent.
    *   **Quantify achievements whenever possible:** Use numbers to demonstrate the impact of your work.
    *   **Tailor your "Experience" descriptions:** Use keywords from the job description and focus on relevant accomplishments.
    *   **Highlight stakeholder interaction and communication:** Show how you gather requirements and document your work.

**3. Resume Rewrite Suggestions:**

I'll provide suggestions section by section, focusing on how to rephrase your existing content to match the job description.

**A. Summary/Introduction:**

*   **Original:** "With over 3 years of experience as a developer, I am driven by a continual love of learning and innovation. My career is marked by efforts to develop web-based applications and improve product quality through code optimization and proactive problem-solving."
*   **Revised:** "A highly motivated web application developer with 3+ years of experience in designing, developing, and deploying web applications. Proficient in front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and back-end development using Python and related frameworks. Proven ability to collaborate with stakeholders to deliver effective solutions, improve user experience, and optimize application performance."

**B. Experience Section - Full Stack Developer (Freelancer/Tar Heel Dev Studio):**

*   **Original:** "Deployed 10 full-stack web applications using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Improved web app performance by 20% using Sentry and Open Replay for performance analysis. Integrated third-party APIs to extend app functionality, enhancing user satisfaction scores by 35%. Streamlined deployment process through Docker containerization, shortening release cycles by 50%. Facilitated community feature adoption by contributing to open-source repositories, benefiting 5 projects. Actively participate in weekly coding challenges to advance my technical skills and promote community growth."
*   **Revised:** (Focus on relevance and keywords)

    *   "Developed and deployed 10+ full-stack web applications using technologies including React, Node.js, and Express.js."
    *   "Implemented Docker containerization to streamline the deployment process, reducing release cycles by 50%." (Keep this, it's great!)
    *   "Enhanced user satisfaction by 35% through integration of third-party APIs, expanding application functionality." (Keep this, it's great!)
    *   "Improved web application performance by 20% through performance analysis using Sentry and Open Replay." (Keep this, it's great!)
    *   "Contributed to 5+ open-source projects, promoting community feature adoption and code quality." (Keep this, it's great!)

**C. Experience Section - SOC Analyst (Iron Range Cyber):**

*   While your SOC Analyst experience demonstrates valuable skills (problem-solving, security awareness), it's less directly relevant to a web application developer role. Consider these options:

    *   **Option 1 (Briefly Mention):** Keep 2-3 bullet points that highlight transferable skills. For example: "Improved incident response rate by 15% through analysis of security events and coordination with SOC managers," could be reworded to emphasize analytical and problem-solving skills.
    *   **Option 2 (Omit/Move):** If you need space, you could move this section to the end of your resume or even omit it. Your full-stack experience is more important for this application.

**D. Geaux Code Educational Content and Developer Resources & Vue.js & MongoDB:**

*   **Original:** "Provide ghostwriting services to over 50 clients that include book contributions, academic lectures, blog posts, and business reports. Create blog posts on topics including web development, behavioral economics, computer science, marketing, and psychology. Produce a weekly newsletter called MEAN Stack Developer that shared coding tips, web developer tools, and open source projects to over 500 subscribers. Contribute technical turorials and articles to software companies, developer blogging platforms, and on social media to educate and inform over 1,000 programmers worldwide."
*   **Revised:** (Focus on relevance and keywords)

*   **Revised:** "Creating and selling custom web development templates, e-books, and code solutions."
*   **Original:** "Contribute to open source project and also follow roadmaps to showcase development of skills and create recommended projects for each skill map"
*   **Revised:** "Contributed to open source projects to showcase development of skills"
*   **Original:** "Completed half of all courses which include: Python, Algorithms, Data Structures, OOP, Functional Programming, Linux Terminal, Git, Go Lang, Kubernetes, and Advanced Algorithms"

    *   HTML
    *   CSS
    *   JavaScript
    *   Python (very important - list any frameworks like Flask or Django if you know them)
    *   SQL (mention specific database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc., if you have experience)
    *   Git
    *   Docker
    *   React
    *   Node.js
    *   Express.js
    *   MongoDB

**F. General Formatting and Content:**

*   **Conciseness:** Keep descriptions concise and focused on relevant achievements.
*   **Action Verbs:** Start each bullet point with a strong action verb (Developed, Implemented, Improved, Managed, etc.).
*   **Keywords:** Use keywords from the job description throughout your resume.
*   **Tailor, Tailor, Tailor:** The more you can directly connect your experience to the specific requirements of the job, the better.
