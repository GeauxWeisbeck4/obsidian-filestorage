# Part 2.

In part 1, we learned about common topics in system design interviews. We will now go over a series of sample system design interview questions. In each question, we apply the concepts we learned in part 1 as well as introducing concepts relevant to the specific question.

We begin with chapter 7 on how to design a system like Craigslist, a system that is optimized for simplicity.

Chapters 8â€“10 discuss designs of systems that are themselves common components of many other systems.

Chapter 11 discusses an autocomplete/typeahead service, a typical system that continuously ingests and processes large amounts of data into a few megabytes data structure that users query for a specific purpose.

Chapter 12 discusses an image-sharing service. Sharing and interacting with images and video are basic functionalities in virtually every social application, and a common interview topic. This leads us to the topic of chapter 13, where we discuss a Content Distribution Network (CDN), a system that is commonly used to cost-efficiently serve static content like images and videos to a global audience.

Chapter 14 discusses a text messaging app, a system that delivers messages sent from many users to many other users and should not accidentally deliver duplicate messages.

Chapter 15 discusses a room reservation and marketplace system. Sellers can offer rooms for rent, and renters can reserve and pay for them. Our system must also allow our internal operations staff to conduct arbitration and content moderation.

Chapters 16 and 17 discuss systems that process data feeds. Chapter 16 discusses a news feed system that sorts data for distribution to many interested users, while chapter 17 discusses a data analytics service that aggregates large amounts of data into a dashboard that can be used to make decisions.
